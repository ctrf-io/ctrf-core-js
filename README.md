## TypeScript Types

The library exports comprehensive TypeScript types for working with CTRF reports:

```typescript
import type { Report, Test, Insights } from "ctrf";

function analyzeReport(report: Report): void {
  const flakyTests = report.results.tests.filter((test: Test) => test.flaky);
  const insights = report.insights as Insights;

  console.log(`Flaky rate: ${insights?.flakyRate.current}`);
}
```

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
